### Reflections and Comments

This is the first lab where I started off feeling uneasy about my grasp of the content. I feel like after working through it event handlers and listeners make more sense to me, which is a relief.

It's funny how after actually grabbing the information from the form, this really didn't require much JS. The framework for almost everything else was there already. I modified the functionality of a few existing functions but all in all the implementation was smooth on this one.
