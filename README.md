## Reflections and Comments

The "salmon cookies" project was one of the earlier problem domains that challenged me at every step. The sales data is based upon maximum/minimum customers per hour and average cookies per sale, with the option to add store data as necessary.

This was also my first major attempt at designing a page layout that should be marketable. This involved studying color theory and reading about what makes a page layout stand out. Looking back I recognize areas for improvement, but I'm grateful for how much this project taught me as I worked through it in the early days of my coding career.
