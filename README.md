### Reflections and Comments

This was the kind of project where I just had to remember to breathe. Keep cool, compartmentalize, and tackle each task individually.

I got hung up initially on the idea of adding new shop objects down the line and how naming them will work, but I dropped it when I realized that I actually had a lot of other tasks to worry about. Still haven't figured it out, but I don't think it's that significant for today.

All in all, I'm happy with what I have so far.
